This file was retrieved from
[this repo](https://github.com/mostafah/isiri-6219), but has a few additions to
that. Few characters were added to reflect changes in recent versions of
Unicode. ISIRI 6219 have not been updated to reflect these changes, but we
needed them anyway, and they are very well-documented in Unicode and described
as replacement for characters already in ISIRI 6219.
